# This script returns the flags to be fed to "aclocal" to ensure that
# it finds GTK+'s aclocal macros.
#
# aclocal will search, by default, only in a directory in the same
# tree where it was installed - e.g., if installed in "/usr/bin", it'll
# search only in "/usr/share/aclocal", and if installed in "/usr/local/bin",
# it'll search only in "/usr/local/share/aclocal".
#
# However, there is no guarantee that GTK+ has been installed there; if
# it's not, it won't find the GTK+ autoconf macros, and will complain
# bitterly.
#
# So, if the "share/local" directory under the directory reported by
# "gtk-config --prefix" isn't the same directory as the directory
# reported by "aclocal --print-ac-dir", we return a "-I" flag with
# the first of those directories as the argument.
#
# (If they *are* the same directory, and we supply that "-I" flag,
# "aclocal" will look in that directory twice, and get well and truly
# confused, reporting a ton of duplicate macro definitions.)
